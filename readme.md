Bountify aims to help people realize that each of us lives in [a world of abundance](http://www.resurgence.org/magazine/article4233-a-beautiful-world-of-abundance.html). The foundation of our philosophy is built upon two complementary and fundamental principles drawn from the [10 Principles of Burning Man](http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/):

> ### Gifting
> We are devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.

and

> ### Decommodification
> In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.

The Bountify community believes that all people possess gifts--whether material, physical, intellectual, or spiritual--and that by creating a space where people are able both to share their gifts and articulate their needs, all of us may be brought closer to living in a society where no one's needs go unmet.

As such, the core functionality of the [Bountify website](http://bountify.net) (and its clones) is to

1. Allow people to **create profiles** in which they
2. **Publicize gifts** that they have to share, and
3. **Articulate needs** that are currently unmet through which
4. **Matching algorithms** can connect people
